#Jump Glider Armor

A simple little Minecraft mod that adds some early game armor

Glider Wings - Allow player to glide
Jump Boots - Shoots player into the air when holding jump button( needs balancing, see below )
Jump Glider Leggings - Gives speed 1 ( needs cool name )
Dark Helm of Haste - Allows player to focus on block they're breaking so it breaks a little faster ( haste 1 )( maybe new name? )

###TODO

* balance Jump Boots ( need to add some sort of "fuel" and/or limit height and add cooldown? )

* maybe add feather falling 1 if player is wearing both Glider Wings and Jump Boots?

* edit rendering of player to "lay down" and quit swinging arms when gliding

* remodel wings

* fix/update current textures

* add item texures and .json files

* add crafting recipes and crafing items

* add sounds ( wind for gliding, something magical? dark? when getting boosted in the air )
	
Still need to test on Server ....
