#Jump Glider Armor

A simple little Minecraft mod that adds some early game armor

Glider Wings - Allow player to glide

Jump Boots - Shoots player into the air when holding jump button( needs balancing, see below )

Jump Glider Leggings - Gives speed 1 ( needs cool name )

Dark Helm of Haste - Allows player to focus on block they're breaking so it breaks a little faster ( haste 1 )( maybe new name? )

###TODO

* balance Jump Boots ( need to add some sort of "fuel" and/or limit height and add cooldown? )

* edit rendering of player to "lay down" and quit swinging arms when gliding

* remodel wings ( don't feel the white wings fit with the look of the rest of the armor anymore )

* update current textures ( fixed but still need work )

* add sounds ( wind for gliding, something magical? dark? when getting boosted in the air )
	
Still need to test on Server ....
	
###License?

As for licensing, you can do as you wish as long as you don't distribute as your own, sell, or upload the Jump Glider Armor mod anywhere ( only use links that I have created ). Especially don't use adfly links or anything like that which you can make money off of. So basically just use download links that I've created and don't profit from it.

For modpacks if you wanna let me know that's fine but I imagine contacting every mod owner for a pack can get extreme so I'd understand if you didn't.

Pull requests welcome, encouraged really. If you contribute you will get recognition here and you're welcome to comment any code that you've changed/written.
